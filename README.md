## About Me ðŸš€

I'm Kid A, a physics enthusiast based in Norway, on a never-ending quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe. As a dedicated physics student, I dive headfirst into the intriguing realms of quantum mechanics, quantum information, and the foundations that underpin this captivating field.

My programming toolkit includes Kotlin, Python, C++, HTML/CSS, Vue.js, SQL, and Mathematica, allowing me to not only explore the quantum world but also craft elegant digital solutions to complex problems.

I'm passionate about sharing my insights and opinions on physics and quantum mechanics, and I never shy away from a deep and engaging discussion.
